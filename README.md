# :iphone: MyQuizMobile

#### :mortar_board: This repository contains a coursework project.


### :scroll: Description

The application represents an alternative implementation to combine the [**MyQuizSupervisor**](https://github.com/TitanNano/MYQuizSupervisor) and [**MyQuizAdmin**](https://github.com/DerTieran/MyQuizAdmin) roles of the MyQuiz project. It communicates with the [**MyQuizBackend**](https://github.com/Kulu-M/MyQuizBackend) to create, send and supervise votes which are then sent to [**MyQuizClients**](https://github.com/TitanNano/MYQuizClient). Managing all relevant data contained in the DataModel like Groups, SingleTopics, QuestionBlocks, Questions and AnswerOptions should also possible. It is planned to implement a comprehensive UI to show visual statistics of previous votes.
 
 For the time being, only **_Android_** is a target plattform until all functionality is implemented to avoid the necessity of creating custom, platformspecific renderers.
